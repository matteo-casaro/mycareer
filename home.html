            From an early age, I had a fascination with solving complex problems and uncovering patterns, often
            challenging myself with math problems and logic puzzles. These activities ignited a deep curiosity and a
            passion for understanding how things work at their core, ultimately inspiring me to pursue a degree in
            physics. This choice felt natural, as physics combined the rigor of mathematics with a quest to explore the
            fundamental laws governing the universe.

            However, my journey through university was not without its challenges. While I excelled in the foundational
            and practical aspects of physics, I found the latter stages of the curriculum, particularly the more
            advanced and abstract theoretical subjects, less aligned with my interests. These topics, while
            intellectually stimulating, lacked the tangible and applied nature that I craved, which made the academic
            path less fulfilling. This realization forced me to reflect on what truly inspired me and pushed me toward
            exploring new directions.

            It was during this period of uncertainty that I stumbled upon a hobby that would change the trajectory of my
            life. Through sheer luck and curiosity, I discovered computer programming, a field that perfectly blended
            creativity with structured problem-solving. A course in Java and SQL marked the beginning of an exciting
            journey into the tech world. Not only did it equip me with essential technical skills, but it also opened
            the door to my first job in the industry. This opportunity reignited my passion for tackling challenges,
            this time in the digital realm, and laid the foundation for a fulfilling and enduring career in technology.
